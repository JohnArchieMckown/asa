A POSIX.2 compliant asa(1), for converting Fortran carraige control
characters to line printer control characters.

This version uses nroff - type overstriking to get the '+'
functionality (i.e. first character, then a backspace, then the next
character.  Less understands this; I'm not too sure about printers or
printer filters.

Do a 'make install' to install it, 'make demo' to see what it does.
